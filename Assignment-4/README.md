# Assignment 2 - Online Food Delivery Membership Prototype
## Description
This assignment is meant for you to exercise the skills you've developed in CIDM2315 and CIDM3312 such that you implement a quick prototype of the Online Grocery Delivery project (from previous assignments) with at least four ASP.NET 7.0 Razor views/forms which perform support the business transactions of the system.  This is by no means meant to be a complete application, rather, this is meant to demonstrate to me that you have the basic skills to be productive.  I am providing you with some guidelines/constraints for the project.
Advice and Guidance
As you work with your teammates, please bear in mind that your implementation should reflect and be informed by your design documents.  Also, take care that you do not just simply rely on scaffolded pages for all user interactions as many process flows you've designed are not going to be simple CRUD operations.
## Requirements
Create at least four ASP.NET 7.0 (using Razor pages form/views that utilize a local SQLite database (DB file)
These forms/views should show the function of a business transaction from the broader Online Food Delivery application.
Each form should facilitate transations and operations that implement the design assumptions of your analysis and design artifacts
Each form should be, ideally if possible, from a different actor's perspective
## Teams
You will work with your teams; Perhaps that could be somebody you worked with in Assignment 2.
Install the LiveShare for Visual Studio Code (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/).
Here is an elaboration on LiveShare (https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share).
Here is a demo of how LiveShare can be used for the assignment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ceblXTBBc).
Arrange to spend at least two hours working on this assignment project together as a Pair Programming exercise.   Your team will likely have to arrange this internally.
Provide a report of the pairing experience along with the code for this assignment. 
Watch this video to get a sense of what Pair Programming is meant to be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-x-T34z9w
Also, trade places during the exercise where one of you is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator" as Lucy Bain explains in that video.
You will prepare a one-page report outlining what advantages and disadvantages you experienced during pairing.  These are YOUR experience specific to your participation and not a generic explanation of what Pair Programming is.
While the requirement is to spend a minimum of the two hours, you are welcome to continue to pair for a longer duration.
## Refresher Tutorials
You might find that Microsoft's resources on ASP.NET Core to be useful. Further, since ASP.NET is now at version 7.0, there may be some changes since you took CIDM3312 and CIDM4360. Have a look at the overall resources available here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-7.0
## Github
From this point forward, I will expect code submissions to be provided both as a ZIPPED archive as well as pushed to a Github repository.  Your team will need to create a shared repository for this and I will need to be included (my username is: ahuimanu).
I have more to share and follow up soon and will post a video dedicated to that.
Brad Traversy's "crash course" and tutorial are a good start for using Git and Github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc
## Report as Markdown
Please include your pairing report as a part of the code repository.  You are asked to write the report using MarkDown and to name the report "Your Name-PairingReport.MD."  Your team will do well to use this (or a similar) reference: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started
